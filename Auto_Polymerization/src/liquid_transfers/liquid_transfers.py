def priming_pumps():
#code for priming the lines of all pumps connected to reaction components  (monomer, solvent, initiator, cta) with the corresponding component
    #needs to open the gas valve
    #needs to pump the component to the reaction vial
    #needs to flush the flowpath to the reaction vial with gas
    #needs to close the gas valve
    #needs to flush the syringe with purge solvent to waste vessel (ca. 0.5 times the volume of the transferred component)

def adding_component():
#command for adding a specific component to reaction vial and flushing the flowpath to the reaction vial before rising the syringe with purge solvent to waste vessel
