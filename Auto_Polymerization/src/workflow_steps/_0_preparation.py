_0_preparation.py

Preparation module for the Auto_Polymerization workflow.
Encapsulates all steps required to prepare the system before polymerization, including NMR shimming, vial handling, heatplate preheating, gas valve control, and tubing priming.

All user-editable settings (draw_speeds, dispense_speeds, volumes, temperatures, etc.) should be set in users/config/platform_config.py and supplied as arguments from the controller.

Supported keys for draw_speeds and dispense_speeds include: 'solvent', 'monomer', 'initiator', 'cta', 'modification', 'nmr', 'uv_vis'.

All functions are designed to be called from a workflow controller script.
"""
# Example usage:
# from users.config import platform_config as config
# draw_speeds = config.draw_speeds
# dispense_speeds = config.dispense_speeds
# polymerization_temp = config.polymerization_temp
# set_rpm = config.set_rpm

# All transfer calls use .get() for draw_speeds and dispense_speeds, so new keys are supported automatically.
# If you add new components to the config, ensure to use the same keys in your workflow logic.
